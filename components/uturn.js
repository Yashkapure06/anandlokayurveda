                            from his immediate companions including parents, siblings, peers, etc. Thus, it involves
                            a pure psychological and innate control over the physical and sensory activities. When
                            this initiation, control, and co-ordination are disturbed, it leads to the derangement

                            </b> Ayurveda narrated this phenomenon as <b>‘Prajnaparadha’ (intellectual

                            diseases, e.g., habit of suppression of any natural urge is a result of Prajnaparadha
                            and enlisted as a cause of nearly 50% of the diseases. Reversal of any neurotransmission
                            or improper removal of the waste products formed during metabolism leading to
                            accumulation of toxins is the basic cause of a disease. Therefore, the habit of
                            suppression of urge in improper lifestyle can be considered as one of the root causes of
                            lifestyle diseases. Removal of these accumulated waste products is the first line of
                            treatment as described in Ayurveda by Charaka.<br/><br/><b style={{"padding-left":50+"px"}}>
