                                conception.In Ayurveda, the journey of a child from mother's womb to the outer world
                                is well explained as Garbha Sanskar. The Sanskrit word 'garbha' means foetus and
                                <b>'sanskar'</b> means educating the mind. </b><br/><br/><b style={{"padding-left":50+"px"}}>
                                What we are today is what we were in the womb!</b> It is not only the genes which
                            matter but the functionality of the genes (epigenetics)i.e. intra uterine foetal
                            programming depends on the atmosphere in the womb. Hence effective Garbha Samskara is
                            being provided to the couple who are planning for conscious pregnancy thus leading to
                            effective parenting. It is believed that the baby's personality begins to take shape in
                            the womb, and this can be influenced by the mother's state of mind during pregnancy.
                            This knowledge can be traced back to ancient scriptures and is included in the
                            Vedas.<br/><br/><b style={{"padding-left":50+"px"}}> </b> According to <b>Garbha sanskar</b>,
                            your baby is able to sense and respond to outside influences like music and other sounds
                            as well as your thoughts and feelings. That is why well-meaning elders in the family,
                            talk about the importance of staying positive and relaxed during pregnancy. <br/><br/><b
                                style={{"padding-left":50+"px"}}> </b>Presently when the pregnant women approaches the
                            obstetricians for antenatal care, it is too late in terms of preconceptional care, as
                            organogenesis would have been completed by that time. Several researchers have found
                            that the first 280 days in the mother’s womb has the utmost bearing on the future mental
                            and physical health of the individual. We pass more mile stones while in the womb than
                            after being born. <br/><br/><b style={{"padding-left":50+"px"}}> </b><b>Aakar</b> offers
