                            healthy-lifestyle system that people in India have used for more than 5,000 years. Ayurveda cures the root
                            problem, not just symptoms. The holistic medicine aims to restore health by understanding the underlying
                            causes of the diseases. It strives to attack the root causes and detoxifying, cleansing, strengthening
                            body tissues (dhatus) and balancing bodily doshas, ensuring complete cure. <br/><strong
                                style={{"padding-left":"105px"}}>Ayurveda</strong> emphasizes good health and prevention and treatment of
                            illness through lifestyle practices (such as panchakrma, meditation, yoga, and dietary changes) and the
                            use of herbal remedies. Ayurvedic medicine is holistic, which means viewing the body and mind as a whole.
                            Ayurveda not only treats a person's physical complaints, but it also changes lifestyle practices to help
                            maintain or improve health. <br/><strong style={{"padding-left":"105px"}}>Treatment In Ayurvedic

                            these must be nurtured if an individual is to have good health. Ayurvedic medicine aims to integrate and
                            balance the body, mind, and spirit .This balance is believed to lead to happiness and health, and to help
                            prevent illness. Ayurveda offers methods of finding out early stages of diseases that are still unknown to
                            modern medical science. The main goal of Ayurveda is prevention as well as promotion of the body’s own
                            capacity for maintenance and balance. </p>
