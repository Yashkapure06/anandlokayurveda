                                        spiritual knowledge about 5,000 years ago. These same mystical aficionados developed

                                        science in the West often refers to the three body types as mesomorph, ectomorph,
                                        and endomorph, which reflect the three doshas discovered by the ancient sages </p>

                                        are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Most people have one dominant dosha and a secondary
                                        dosha. This interesting science allows you to look at someone’s physical
                                        constitution and deduce their core personality, food preferences and even sleep
                                        patterns. For example, slow-moving Kapha often has wide hands and feet, thick hair

                                    <h3>The 3 Doshas &amp; Their Elements:</h3>
                                    <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}><b style={{paddingLeft:"50px"}}></b> We have all three
                                        doshas to a certain degree in our lives. Ideally, we find balance in the ways that
                                        each of these doshas express themselves. Because this system is so old, it is also
                                        something that cannot be mastered by reading one article. Your dominant dosha can be
                                        determined by in-depth quizzes developed by Ayurvedic experts. When we are born, we
                                        have one dominant dosha, which is our prakruti. This is our natural constitution
                                        which we can learn about in order to keep our emotions and health as balanced as
                                        possible. The fluctuating imbalance that we are constantly paying attention to is
                                        referred to as vikriti. Imbalances are revealed by low energy, negative emotional
                                        states, and health problems. The solution mostly lies in balancing the elements
                                        using herbs and foods. </p><br/>
                                    <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}><b style={{paddingLeft:"50px"}}></b> The two main
                                        principles that guide Ayurveda are that the mind and the body are inextricably
                                        connected and nothing has more power to heal and transform the body than the mind.
                                        The mind becomes aware of the state it’s in through meditation and then chooses how
                                        to best regulate the body chemistry like adding colors to a painting to get the
                                        desired result, except the colors are a variety of plants. </p><br/>
                                    <h4>Vata</h4>
                                    <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}><b style={{paddingLeft:"50px"}}></b> Vata is linked to
                                        the air element. Someone with a dominant Vata dosha is often thin and has a small
                                        bone structure. They are likely to forget to eat and even have irregular sleep
                                        patterns. They get scatterbrained and anxious if they have too much caffeine because
                                        their metabolism and brain are already active by nature. They often have trouble
                                        putting on weight or keeping it on so eating foods with healthy fats is essential to
                                        staying well. Because they have a lot of mental energy they can stay balanced by
                                        eating root vegetables and cooked vegetables. Eating on a regular schedule can help
                                        reduce scattered thinking and anxiety that can come from hyperactivity or too much
                                        mental stimulation. An exercise that is fast could lead to too much energy and
                                        slower more deliberate exercise is recommended. Vata’s don’t do well on an all raw
                                        diet and can utilize their natural intellectual abilities best when they eat every
                                        couple of hours. </p><br/>
                                    <h4>Pitta</h4>
                                    <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}><b style={{paddingLeft:"50px"}}></b> Pitta is linked to
                                        the fire element. A person with a dominant Pitta dosha will be muscular and
                                        athletic. They often have strong motivation, natural leadership abilities and can be
                                        a bit aggressive when out of balance. They can have a temper f they do not work to
                                        cool their jets through cooling foods and calming exercises. They are advised to
                                        avoid spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol because foods with heat will stoke their
                                        natural flames into a blazing bonfire so to speak. That can lead to over-acidity in
                                        the body which can appear as rashes. The pitta can be a strong and charismatic
                                        person when in balance. They are naturally confident and love to accomplish great
                                        feats, always willing to take on a challenge. However, they also can tend to be
                                        workaholics or perfectionists because of their strong desire to achieve and push
                                        themselves. An exercise that calms their nerves helps balance their fast metabolism
                                        and foods like cucumber, mint, and slow carb grains can give them proper energy that
                                        balances their emotions. Skipping meals will make a Pitta dominant person ‘hangry’
                                        and they need to have snacks handy to manage their blood sugar. </p><br/>
                                    <h4>Kapha</h4>
                                    <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}><b style={{paddingLeft:"50px"}}></b> Kapha is linked to
                                        the water and earth elements. These are people who have a slow metabolism, heavier
                                        bone structure and tend to move slowly. They crave comfort foods but that can
                                        exacerbate their slow metabolism. They should avoid dairy and red meat which require
                                        energy to process. They can stick to lightly cooked vegetables, fruit, spicy foods,
                                        and some caffeine to boost their metabolism. They can become depressed if they don’t
                                        get exercise daily. Fast walking and yoga are great for a Kapha dominant person as
                                        well as breath of fire, which boosts their slow metabolism. They are loyal,
                                        kind-hearted, salt of the earth type people who tend to put others before
                                        themselves. They can fall into laziness if they don’t stay balanced with light foods
                                        and daily movement. They often have big eyes, wide cheekbones, and wide hips. They
                                        are slow to make big decisions but if out of balance, they can become stubborn and
                                        resist necessary change. </p><br/>

                                        require a certain amount of digestive power. If we have a slow metabolism, we need
                                        to eat foods that do not require a lot of energy to digest. If we are anxious or
                                        having insomnia, we can ground ourselves by eating heavier foods. If we are having
                                        depression, we can look to eat light to raise our energy levels. Being aware of what
                                        emotions and mental states you’re having as well as your energy levels can help you
                                        choose which foods will be best for you. Our doshas can fluctuate depending on the
                                        weather and other factors such as stress and activity levels. Herbs and spices are
                                        used as medicine to help balance your stress levels as they fluctuate by helping
                                        your hormones stay balanced. </p><br/>
                                    <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}><b style={{paddingLeft:"50px"}}></b> We look at foods in
                                        terms of their bitterness, sweetness, spiciness, sourness, and heaviness to manage
                                        the metabolic rate as well as mental energy. Someone with too much creativity and no
                                        ability to implement could look to ground their energy while someone with no
                                        creativity and too much analytical energy could look to the stimulating foods. We
                                        start to see our energy in a much more intimate and chemical manner and we study how
                                        the shifting environment and demands of our lives require new foods to be introduced
                                        or eliminated. There are seasons that are dominated by each dosha and we can adjust
                                        our diet to balance those energies as well although that is more in-depth than we
                                        are going today. </p>
